Goal:
Rebuild the entire Relief Request workflow UI so that it looks exactly like the Needs Lists workflow screens shown in the reference images provided — including layout, spacing, colors, navigation, workflow sidebar, cards, form patterns, table patterns, status badges, confirmation banners, and page structure.

You must follow modern UI/UX best practices AND WCAG accessibility standards.

Do NOT change or modify the database schema or backend logic.
Use the existing DRIMS database (reliefrqst, reliefrqst_item, etc.) exactly as they are.

🎯 High-Level Requirements
Replicate the Needs Lists UI for Relief Requests:

You must replicate every UI/UX pattern used in the Needs Lists workflow, including:

Top banner alerts (green success, blue info, yellow warning)

Status badges ("Draft", "Submitted", "Completed", etc.)

Summary cards (Total Items, Allocated, Partial, Unallocated, etc.)

Right-hand Workflow Sidebar that shows the step the user is on
(identical layout, icons, spacing, colors)

Workflow Timeline UI (icons, vertical line, timestamps, user info)

Tables with alternating row colors, sticky headers, SKU lines, badges

Back button placement

Consistent spacing / paddings

Consistent card shadows, rounded corners, layout grid

Lock banner at the top (e.g., “You are currently editing this…”)

Exact left-side navigation pattern for the Relief Request module

Your goal is to create a pixel-consistent Relief Request workflow to match the needs-lists UI shown.

📌 Pages to Create (Mirror Needs-Lists)
1. Relief Requests List Page

Replicate the Needs Lists list page UI:

Filter tabs (Submitted, Draft, Awaiting Approval, Approved)

Table with:

Request Number

Requesting Agency

Priority badge

Items count

Submitted timestamp

Action button (e.g., “Review Eligibility”, “Prepare Fulfillment”)

Navigation title: Relief Requests

Consistent green header strip and breadcrumb/back button behavior

2. Create / Edit Relief Request Page

Replicate the “Review Your Needs List (Draft)” screen:

Summary cards (Total items, Allocated, Partial, etc.)

Draft status pill

Blue info panel at top describing “Next Steps”

Editable item table with:

Item name

SKU text line

Quantity requested

Status (Draft / Awaiting Submission)

Right-side workflow sidebar with 4 steps:

Create Request

Submit to ODPEM

ODPEM Processing

Receive Items

Ensure a Save Draft button is present (WCAG-compliant button)

3. Relief Request Details Page

Replicate the Completed Needs Lists page shown:

Large green “Completed” badge

Request number formatting (e.g., RR-000012)

Requesting hub/agency name beneath

Workflow Completed message with icon

Summary metric cards (Total, Fulfilled, Rate, Shortfall, Dispatched, Received)

Green “Confirmed By” panel

Workflow Timeline:

Full visual vertical timeline with icons, timestamps, and status text

Workflow Sidebar:

Each step marked with ✓ when completed

Highlight the current step

Use the same spacing, borders, and typography

4. Fulfillment / Allocation Page

Mirror “Prepare Fulfillment” UI:

Lock banner with expiration timer

Summary metrics cards (Total items, Fully Allocated, Unallocated)

Search & filter controls exactly as in Needs Lists

Item rows:

Item name

SKU

Requested quantity

Allocation dropdown

Remaining quantity

Status badges

Right-side workflow sidebar with 3 steps (Submitted → Prepare → Approval → Execute)

Notes panel with textarea

Save as Draft button at bottom

♿ WCAG 2.1 AA Requirements (Mandatory)

You must apply WCAG best practices to every element:

Keyboard Accessibility

Every button, tab, row, and sidebar item must be reachable via keyboard.

Focus outline must be visible and meet 3:1 contrast minimum.

Color & Contrast

All text and icons must meet WCAG contrast ratios.

Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning — use icons + labels.

ARIA & Semantic Structure

Use real <h1>, <h2>, <h3> hierarchy.

Add aria-current="step" to the active workflow sidebar item.

Add role="region" to summary card sections with aria-label.

Form Accessibility

Every input must have a <label>

Required fields must announce requirements with aria-required="true"

Error messages must be tied via aria-describedby

Responsive Behavior

Pages must be fully responsive:

Sidebar stacks under main content on mobile

Metric cards wrap gracefully

Tables become scrollable rather than overflowing

🔧 Technical Implementation Rules
Do NOT modify:

Database schema

Table names

Column names

Backend logic for creating or updating data

Allowed:

Create new templates

Create new routes that use existing backend logic

Create new partials/components (sidebar, summary cards, status badges)

Add helper functions for formatting UI

Template Naming Convention

Use naming mirroring needs-lists:

templates/relief_requests/
    list.html
    edit.html
    details.html
    prepare.html
    review.html
    completed.html
    _workflow_sidebar.html
    _summary_cards.html
    _timeline.html

🧭 Navigation Update

Add a new sidebar item:

Relief Requests
with icon identical style to Needs Lists icon.

Placement:
Under OPERATIONS
just below Needs Lists.

🎨 Visual Consistency Requirements

Replicate exactly:

Card shadows

Border radius

Font sizes

Font family

Iconography

Spacing system (margin-xl, padding-lg, etc.)

Table structure

Pill/Badge styling

Notification system (flash messages)

Button size and color

The UI for Relief Requests must be indistinguishable from Needs Lists, aside from wording.

📄 Deliverables

Fully implemented UI pages for the Relief Request workflow

All sidebar and navigation integrations

Reusable WCAG-compliant components

Zero changes to database schema

Pages visually identical to screenshot reference
