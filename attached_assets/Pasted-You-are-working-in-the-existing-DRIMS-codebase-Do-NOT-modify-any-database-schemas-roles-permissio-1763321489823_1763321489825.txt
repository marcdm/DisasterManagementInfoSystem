You are working in the existing DRIMS codebase.
Do NOT modify any database schemas, roles, permissions, or existing Event logic.
These are already implemented.

Your task is to update and standardize the UI and navigation for the Event Management module so that it is fully aligned with the look, feel, patterns, and workflow templates used in the Relief Request and Relief Package modules.

🎯 Primary Objective

Ensure the entire Event module (view, create, update, list, filter, and detail pages) matches the UI templates, navigation structure, layout patterns, and user experience used in the Relief Request & Package Workflow.

This includes:

Page layout

Form layout

Sidebar navigation

Workflow indicators

Tabs, breadcrumbs, buttons, spacing, styling, typography, and responsive behaviour

UX standards and interaction patterns

WCAG accessibility requirements

Mobile responsiveness for phones & tablets

Visual hierarchy and component use consistency

All redesign must be consistent with the established DRIMS UI system.

🧭 UI & Navigation Requirements
1. Add Event Module to Sidebar Navigation

Position must match the hierarchy and style of the Relief Request / Package modules.

Use the same sidebar styling, active-state behaviour, icons, and hover effects.

Ensure the active menu highlighting follows the existing pattern.

2. Use the Same Page Templates

All Event module pages must use the same UI layout template used in:

Create Relief Request

Edit Relief Request

Package Creation Workflow

Fulfillment workflow

Summary & Detail screens

Including:

Top heading bar

Left-aligned title

Right-aligned action buttons (if applicable)

Page-wide container width rules

Section headers and spacing

Consistent card layouts

Consistent table formatting

📄 Event Pages to Update

You must update these Event module screens to match the DRIMS templates:

Event List Page

Must use the same table design as Relief Requests:

Table header styling

Row spacing

Hover behaviour

Pagination style

Include filters positioned exactly like the Relief Request filters.

Create Event Page

Must use the same form layout:

Two-column form layout where appropriate

Section grouping with section headers

Consistent button placement (“Save”, “Cancel”)

Apply required field markers and validation messages matching the DRIMS standard.

Update Event Page

Match the Relief Request “Edit” screen templates.

Include:

Audit data placement (created by, updated by)

Version conflict messaging consistent with the DRIMS pattern

Event Detail / View Page

Use the same “details card” layout as the Relief Request detail view.

Display:

Event name

Event type

Status (with same badge style as requests)

Start date / Closed date

Reason for closure (if applicable)

Descriptions (with rich text rendering)

Follow the same spacing, grouping, and fonts.

🧩 Workflow Consistency Requirements

Even though the Event module does not follow a multi-step workflow like Relief Packaging, it MUST visually appear consistent with DRIMS workflow standards:

1. Workflow bar (if applicable)

If Events contain state changes (Active → Closed):

Show a workflow-like indicator styled the same as the fulfillment flow but simplified.

Use the same badge or progress style for statuses.

2. Button Placement

All page action buttons must replicate the Relief Request pattern:

Primary actions on right (blue buttons)

Secondary on left (gray outline)

Confirmation modals with same styles + language

3. Field-Level Validation

Messages must appear:

Under field

In red text (#d9534f or equivalent DRIMS color)

Same font size

Same icon (if used in other modules)

4. Success & Error Notifications

Use the same toast/alert notification component used in the Relief Request workflow.

📱 Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness

Make the Event module responsive using the same breakpoints and layout rules used in:

Relief Request workflow

Fulfillment workflow

Dashboard views

This includes:

Form fields stacking correctly

Tables transforming into mobile-friendly list cards

Buttons repositioning for small screens

Ensuring no horizontal scroll on mobile

🛡 Accessibility Requirements (WCAG / DRIMS Standard)

Apply the same WCAG 2.1 AA compliance rules used in Relief Requests:

High-contrast text

Keyboard navigability

Proper ARIA labels

Error messages announced by screen reader

Focus management on page load and field errors

🔄 Do Not Modify Back-End Logic

The following MUST NOT be changed:

Custodian role

Permissions

Existing Event CRUD logic

Database tables

API endpoints already implemented

Existing creation/update validation logic

This prompt is strictly for UI, UX, navigation, and interaction consistency.

✔️ Deliverables

You must output:

Updated frontend components/pages for all Event module screens

Updated navigation/sidebar integration

Updated styling to align with DRIMS templates

Responsive and WCAG-compliant UI

No backend changes except minimal additions needed for UI rendering (e.g., new routes pointing to existing backend logic)
