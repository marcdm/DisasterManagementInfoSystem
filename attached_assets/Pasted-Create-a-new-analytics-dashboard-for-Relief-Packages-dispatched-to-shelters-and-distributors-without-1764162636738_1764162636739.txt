Create a new analytics dashboard for Relief Packages dispatched to shelters and distributors without breaking any existing code, workflows, behaviour, security fixes, or the database schema.
1. Purpose & Access Control


Add a new page, e.g. “Relief Package Analytics”, separate from the Donation Analytics page.


This dashboard must be read-only and visible only to the roles:


Director General (DG)


Deputy Director General (Deputy DG)


Director, PEOD


Logistics Manager




Reuse the existing role/feature permission framework in the app; do not invent new auth logic or bypass current checks.


2. Data Scope


Include only relief packages that have been dispatched to shelters or distributors.


Use the existing tables and fields (e.g. reliefpkg, reliefpkg_item, reliefrqst, warehouse, agency, location, etc.) and the existing status codes that indicate a package is dispatched/issued (e.g. current “Dispatched” or “Issued” status field).


No changes to database schema, constraints, or indexes.


3. Top KPI Cards (executive summary)
Create KPI cards at the top of the dashboard, similar visual style to Donation Analytics:


Total Relief Packages Dispatched


Count of all dispatched relief packages in the selected period.




Total Items Dispatched


Sum of all item quantities included in dispatched packages.




Total Beneficiary Locations


Count of distinct shelters/distributors/locations that received packages.




Total Requests Fulfilled


Count of distinct relief requests that have at least one dispatched package.




(Use existing date filters or provide a simple default range such as “All time”, with option to filter by date if there is already a shared filter component.)
4. Charts & Visuals (management view)
Add charts using the same charting library already used in Donation Analytics:


Packages by Destination Type


Bar or donut chart breaking down dispatched packages by destination category:


Shelters vs Distributors (or whatever categorisation already exists in the schema).






Packages by Parish / Region


Bar or map-style chart (if available) showing number of dispatched packages per parish/region.


Use existing location/parish fields in the schema (no new fields).




Trend of Packages Dispatched Over Time


Line or bar chart showing number of packages dispatched by week or month (using dispatch date / issue date).




Top Shelters/Distributors by Packages Received


Horizontal bar chart listing the top N shelters/distributors by:


count of packages, or


total item quantity.






5. Tabular Detail (drill-down)
Include a read-only table below the charts for drill-down:
Columns might include (all using existing fields):


Package ID / Tracking No


Linked Request ID / Tracking No


Destination name (shelter/distributor/agency)


Parish / Region


Dispatch date


Number of items in package


Status (Dispatched, Delivered, etc. – using existing status codes)


Allow sorting and simple filtering (e.g. by parish, destination type, date range) if existing components already support this.
6. UX & Consistency


Match the look and feel of the current Donation Analytics dashboard:


Same card style, colours, typography, spacing, and responsiveness.




The dashboard is view-only; no buttons for editing, cancelling, or creating packages.


Integrate it into existing navigation for the allowed roles (e.g. sidebar link “Relief Package Analytics”), without altering other roles’ menus.


7. Constraints


Do not modify any database tables or add new columns.


Do not change any existing business logic for creating, dispatching, or updating relief packages.


Do not weaken or change any security controls (auth, CSRF, CSP, headers, etc.).


Reuse existing services/repositories for fetching relief package data where possible; avoid duplicating logic.


Outcome:
Executives and managers with roles DG, Deputy DG, Director PEOD, and Logistics Manager can open a Relief Package Analytics dashboard that gives them a clear, visual overview of how many packages are being dispatched, to where, and over what period—without impacting any existing functionality.
