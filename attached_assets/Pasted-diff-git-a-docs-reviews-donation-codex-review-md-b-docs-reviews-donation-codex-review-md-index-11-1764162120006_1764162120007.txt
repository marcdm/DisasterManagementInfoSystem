 # Codex Review: Donation Feature
 
 ## Findings
 
-1. **Uploaded documents are never persisted to storage**
-   - In `create_donation`, each uploaded file is validated and a `DonationDoc` record is created, but the file content is never saved to disk or another storage backend. Only the filename metadata is stored, meaning downloads will fail because the referenced files do not exist. Add a file save step (e.g., `uploaded_file.save(path)` or cloud upload) after generating the unique filename so the stored metadata points to an actual asset.
-   - Suggested test: create a donation with an attachment and verify the file is written to the configured media location, then downloaded via the UI without a 404.
+1. **Document uploads silently drop when storage is misconfigured**
+   - `create_donation` and the verification save path both validate uploaded files and prepare `DonationDoc` rows, but they only attempt to persist files if `UPLOAD_FOLDER` is set. When the setting is missing or empty, the code exits without saving files or logging an error, leaving validated attachments unpersisted while the request still succeeds. Fail fast when storage is unavailable, or enforce a required upload directory during app startup so attachments cannot be discarded implicitly.
+   - Suggested test: unset `UPLOAD_FOLDER` (or set it to an unwritable location), submit a donation with a PDF, and assert the request fails with a clear error instead of returning success while dropping the file.
 
 2. **Total donation value is not reconciled with item costs**
-   - The handler computes `total_value` from the donation items but ultimately writes `tot_item_cost_value` from the form directly to the donation header. No check ensures the submitted header total matches the calculated item total, so inconsistent data can be persisted. Either replace the header value with the computed `total_value` or validate that they match before commit.
-   - Suggested test: submit a donation where header total differs from the sum of item totals and confirm the request is rejected with a validation error rather than persisting inconsistent data.
+   - The create and verify handlers compute `total_value` from the items but ultimately persist `tot_item_cost_value` from the form without using or comparing the computed sum. No guard prevents a user from entering a header total that disagrees with the line totals, so inconsistent donation amounts can be stored. Replace the header value with the computed sum or validate the numbers match before commit.
+   - Suggested test: submit (and verify) a donation where the header total differs from the sum of item totals and confirm the request is rejected with a validation error rather than persisting inconsistent data.
 
 ## Recommendations
 
-- Add unit tests around `create_donation` to cover both attachment persistence and header/item total reconciliation, so regressions are caught automatically.
+- Add unit tests around the donation flow to cover attachment persistence and header/item total reconciliation, so regressions are caught automatically.
 - Ensure the document storage path (local or cloud) is configurable through environment settings and validated during startup to avoid silent failures when the path is missing.
