Fix the Donation Items form so that when an item with category_type = 'FUNDS' is selected, the Quantity field is truly non-editable in both the UI and backend, while keeping ALL existing UI, navigation, workflows, logic, database schema, and security fixes unchanged.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change any database tables, columns, constraints, indexes, or triggers.
- Do NOT change any routes, menus, URLs, or page structure.
- Do NOT remove or rename any existing templates or views.
- Do NOT weaken any security or validation logic already in place.
- Only adjust the logic for the Quantity control in the Donation Items block on the donation acceptance page.

Requirements:

1. Detect FUNDS vs GOODS:
   - Use the existing item → itemcatg relationship to determine itemcatg.category_type.
   - The Type field is already showing GOODS or FUNDS; reuse that value to control the Quantity behaviour.

2. UI behaviour for FUNDS:
   - When the selected item’s category_type is FUNDS:
     - Set the Quantity field value to `1` (or 1.00) immediately after the item is chosen.
     - Make the Quantity input NON-EDITABLE:
       • Add `readonly` and/or `disabled` attributes on the input used for Quantity.
       • Ensure any spinner / up-down arrows cannot change the value.
     - Visually indicate that the field is fixed (e.g. keep same style, but user cannot type or change it).
   - This must happen:
     • On initial selection of a FUNDS item.
     • If the user changes from a GOODS item to a FUNDS item.
   - If JavaScript is used, add an event listener on the item dropdown (and any Type toggle) that:
     • Checks if donation_type === 'FUNDS'
     • Forces value = 1 and sets the field to readonly/disabled.
   - Do NOT change the layout or labels; only change behaviour.

3. UI behaviour for GOODS:
   - When category_type = 'GOODS':
     - Quantity must remain exactly as it works now:
       • Default to 1 (if that is the current behaviour).
       • Fully editable by the user.
     - Ensure that any readonly/disabled attributes applied for FUNDS are removed for GOODS so the user can type.

4. Edit mode:
   - When editing an existing donation_item:
     - If donation_type = 'FUNDS':
       • Load Quantity as 1.
       • Keep the Quantity field readonly/disabled.
     - If donation_type = 'GOODS':
       • Load the stored quantity.
       • Keep Quantity editable as it is today.

5. Backend/server-side enforcement:
   - In the POST/PUT handler that processes the Donation Items form:
     - If donation_type = 'FUNDS':
       • Ignore any Quantity value sent from the browser.
       • Force `item_qty = 1` in the server-side code before inserting/updating donation_item.
     - If donation_type = 'GOODS':
       • Keep the current quantity validation and behaviour exactly as it is.
   - This ensures that even if someone tampers with the HTML or request, FUNDS donations always save with item_qty = 1.

6. Validation and messages:
   - Do not add new validation messages unless necessary.
   - Ensure existing required checks still pass (Quantity remains required but always 1 for FUNDS).

Summary:
- FUNDS: Quantity always 1, non-editable in UI, enforced in backend.
- GOODS: Quantity behaves exactly as today.
- No breaking changes to UI design, navigation, workflow, logic, schema, or security.
