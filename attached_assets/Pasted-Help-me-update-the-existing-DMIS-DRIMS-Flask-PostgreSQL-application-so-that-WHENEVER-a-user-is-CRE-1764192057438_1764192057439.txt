Help me update the existing DMIS/DRIMS Flask + PostgreSQL application so that WHENEVER a user is CREATING a relief request, the selectable items are restricted to ONLY category type "GOODS". Items with category type "FUNDS" must never appear in the item filter/list for relief requests.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- DO NOT change any database tables, columns, constraints, indexes, or triggers.
- DO NOT change any existing status codes, workflows, or business logic outside this specific requirement.
- DO NOT break or modify existing donation workflows or any screens that legitimately use FUNDS.
- DO NOT change any existing routes, blueprints, templates, or navigation structure names.
- DO NOT weaken any security controls (CSP, CSRF, auth, role checks, permissions).

Your ONLY job is to adjust the item selection/filtering logic on relief request CREATION so that:
- LO (Logistics Officer),
- LM (Logistics Manager),
- Agency users
see ONLY "GOODS" items in the item dropdowns/search filters when they are creating a relief request.

CONTEXT / EXISTING SCHEMA (ASSUMED)
- There is an `item` table that stores items.
- There is an `itemcatg` (item category) table with at least:
    - category_id
    - category_type (char(5) with values 'GOODS' or 'FUNDS')
- The `item` table is linked to `itemcatg` via a category_id / FK (or equivalent).
- Relief requests use existing pages/routes such as:
    - Agency creates relief request
    - LO/LM creates or edits relief request items
  and these pages currently allow the user to select any item.

REQUIREMENT (WHAT MUST CHANGE)
1. For ALL relief request creation flows (for Agency, LO, and LM):
   - Any UI element that allows selecting an item (dropdown, typeahead, search results, etc.)
     MUST ONLY show items whose related category has:
       itemcatg.category_type = 'GOODS'

2. NO FUNDS items (category_type = 'FUNDS') must appear in:
   - Item dropdowns
   - Item search/autocomplete boxes
   - Any item listing used strictly for picking items to include in a relief request

3. This restriction applies ONLY to:
   - Relief request creation and relief request item selection.
   - It must NOT affect donation intake, donation item management, inventory screens, or any other part of the system that legitimately needs to show FUNDS.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A. SERVER-SIDE FILTERING
- Find the backend code (Flask view functions, services, or repository/DAO functions) responsible for:
  - Loading the item list for relief request creation pages.
  - Serving any item search APIs used by those pages (e.g., `/api/items/search` used by relief requests).

- Modify these queries so they JOIN with itemcatg and filter by category_type = 'GOODS'.

For example (pseudocode / SQL-style):

Instead of something like:
    SELECT i.*
    FROM   item i
    WHERE  i.status_code = 'A'
    ORDER BY i.item_desc;

Use:
    SELECT i.*
    FROM   item i
    JOIN   itemcatg c ON c.category_id = i.category_id
    WHERE  i.status_code = 'A'
      AND  c.category_type = 'GOODS'
    ORDER BY i.item_desc;

- Apply this pattern to:
  - Any endpoint that is used to populate item dropdowns for relief request creation.
  - Any search/filter logic that returns items to be added to a relief request.

B. SCOPE THE CHANGE TO RELIEF REQUEST USE CASES ONLY
- If the same item search or dropdown is used in multiple places (e.g., donations + relief requests), do NOT blindly restrict all of them.
- Either:
  - Introduce a parameter or flag in the service/repository call that indicates "for relief request", and then apply the category_type = 'GOODS' filter only in that case,
  OR
  - Create a dedicated "relief-request item lookup" function/endpoint that always filters by category_type = 'GOODS' and use this only on relief request screens.

C. FRONTEND / TEMPLATE USAGE
- Ensure that the relief request creation templates (for Agency, LO, LM) are wired to the updated endpoint(s) that return only GOODS items.
- Do NOT change the visual design or labels; just ensure the data source for item lists is now GOODS-only for relief requests.

D. PERMISSIONS
- All existing role/permission checks (Agency, LO, LM) MUST remain unchanged.
- Only modify the data returned for item selection, not which users can access the screen.

E. NO CHANGE TO EXISTING DATA OR CATEGORIES
- Do NOT modify existing item or itemcatg rows.
- Do NOT change category_type values.
- Do NOT migrate or re-tag any data.
- Simply filter at query level to exclude FUNDS items from relief request item selection.

TESTING & VALIDATION
- Confirm that:
  - Agency, LO, LM users can still create relief requests normally.
  - Item dropdowns/search controls on relief request creation pages only show GOODS items.
  - FUNDS items are never presented as selectable in any relief request creation flow.
- Confirm that:
  - Donation workflows, inventory screens, and any FUNDS-related views still behave exactly as before (FUNDS remain visible where they were previously visible and valid).
- Ensure that no errors occur and all existing tests still pass.

SUMMARY
- Implement server-side item filtering so that, when creating a relief request (for Agency, LO, or LM roles), only items with itemcatg.category_type = 'GOODS' appear.
- Do not change workflows A or B, donation flows, or any database schema.
- Keep the rest of the system behaviour unchanged.
